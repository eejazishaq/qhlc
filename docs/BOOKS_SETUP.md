## Database Setup

Run the SQL script to create the `qhlc_books` table:

```sql
\i scripts/create-books-table.sql
```

The system uses the existing `qhlc-storage` bucket. Ensure it exists and has proper policies:

```sql
\i scripts/setup-storage-for-books.sql
```

## Table Structure

```sql
CREATE TABLE qhlc_books (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    title TEXT NOT NULL,                    -- Book title
    description TEXT,                       -- Book description
    author TEXT NOT NULL,                   -- Author name
    category TEXT DEFAULT 'Other',          -- Book category
    pdf_url TEXT NOT NULL,                  -- PDF file URL
    file_size INTEGER DEFAULT 0,            -- File size in bytes
    is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,        -- Public visibility
    download_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,       -- Download counter
